  - how to deal with aliasing in the fog
  - behavior of enemy


- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -
  - correct the canvas sizing when not in the level editor
  - resetting the game breaks the pheromone worker


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - UI
    - replace time miniticker with steps counter

  - add maxSteps
    - level property
    - level editor UI
    - loss condition

  - get level progression working on main play
    - add in more of the original levels
    - store level progress in local storage

  - allow time reversal to be queued on the controlled entity
    - add a flag to gameState for shouldReverseTime
    - when we would enqueue a new action to the controlledEntity but the flag is set,
      instead run the reverseTime helper
    - then continue as normal?

  - implement FoW with lit areas around agents
    - when you reverse time and it creates a new agent, need light for it right away
      - is this because previous agent moves backwards and takes light with it?
      - (don't get new light until you move)
    - deal with aliasing in fog

  - show preview of going back in time if prev agent is about to do that


- - - - - - NICE-TO-HAVE - - - - - - - -
  - way to apply all entities w/ histories directly into game in order to repro bugs


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - level editor playerID is 0 even though it says 1
  - doors opening/closing have a frame at final location before interpolating
  - moveTurn appears broken:
    - cancelling actions and replacing them is a problem
    - effect is that turn theta can end up undefined in reverseHistory
    - undefined turns get inserted when the entity fails to reverse correctly the first time
    - appears to be moveturn that is the problem
