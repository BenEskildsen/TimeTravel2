  - how to manage when doors close based on time travel
    - how to explain this in game?
      - you can forget you went through a door
        - need to indicate buttons that need to be pressed?
      - can't tell the difference between an open door and a closed door
      - can hit issues going through the closed path of a door since it opens
        at a different tick on the next run through
        - ie: 1. go through open door
              2. door closes at step 1 and you go through the path it blocked when open
                 and then press the button to open the door
              3. door now closes at a later step than it did the first time so 2 becomes
                 impossible

- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -
  - doors on the edge of the map opening/closing in fog is briefly visible
  - don't register arrow keys outside of editor (on game loss, modals that pause the game)
  - add restart level button to game over modal
  - winning the level in levelEditor breaks down
  - playtesting:
    - hard to tell when you're gonna run out of steps or hit a door


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - get level progression working on main play
    - add in more of the original levels
    - add in action to win the level
    - store level progress in local storage


- - - - - - FOLLOW UP - - - - - - - -
  - UI
    - add topBar
      - play/pause (probably don't need this at all?)
      - instructions
      - label for which direction time is moving
      - better styling for Steps Remaining label
    - bottom bar
      - button for going back in time
      - buttons for movements (mobile support)

  - animations:
    - show preview of going back in time if prev agent is about to do that
    - upon hitting a loss condition, need to animate before popping modal, etc
      - can make these actions with high effectIndex

  - deployment:
    - set up unique player tracking (and per level)

  - tutorials:


- - - - - - NICE-TO-HAVE - - - - - - - -
  - way to apply all entities w/ histories directly into game in order to repro bugs
  - allow time reversal to be queued on the controlled entity
    - add a flag to gameState for shouldReverseTime
    - when we would enqueue a new action to the controlledEntity but the flag is set,
      instead run the reverseTime helper
    - then continue as normal?
  - only 100 time travels is implicit, should be able to add more pheromones on the fly?


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - level editor playerID is 0 even though it says 1
  - doors opening/closing have a frame at final location before interpolating
  - moveTurn appears broken:
    - cancelling actions and replacing them is a problem
    - effect is that turn theta can end up undefined in reverseHistory
    - undefined turns get inserted when the entity fails to reverse correctly the first time
    - appears to be moveturn that is the problem


- - - - - - - REFACTORS - - - - - - -
  - tickReducer "systems" are checking waaay more often than they need to
  - instead of checking for existence of pheromoneWorker in insert/removeFromGrid
    entity functions, instead just rely on the noPheromone flag


- - - - - - - WON'T FIX - - - - - -
