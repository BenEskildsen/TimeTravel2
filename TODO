  - how to allow time reversal queuing
  - how to deal with aliasing in the fog
  - behavior of enemy


- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -
  - reversing time at the exact time of a reverse time action still breaks
    - print start and destination positions for bad entity
  - correct the canvas sizing when not in the level editor
  - resetting the game breaks the pheromone worker


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - allow time reversal to be queued on the controlled entity
    - put time reversal changes into a helper function
    - add a flag to gameState for shouldReverseTime
    - when we would enqueue a new action to the controlledEntity but the flag is set,
      instead run the reverseTime helper
    - then continue as normal?
  - implement FoW with lit areas around agents
    - when you reverse time and it creates a new agent, need light for it right away
      - is this because previous agent moves backwards and takes light with it?
      - (don't get new light until you move)
    - deal with aliasing in fog
    - track spaces that have been seen before and put them in less fog


- - - - - - NICE-TO-HAVE - - - - - - - -
  - way to apply all entities w/ histories directly into game in order to repro bugs


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - level editor playerID is 0 even though it says 1
  - doors opening/closing have a frame at final location before interpolating
  - moveTurn appears broken:
    - cancelling actions and replacing them is a problem
    - effect is that turn theta can end up undefined in reverseHistory
    - undefined turns get inserted when the entity fails to reverse correctly the first time
    - appears to be moveturn that is the problem
