  - how to manage when doors close based on time travel
    - how to explain this in game?
      - you can forget you went through a door
        - need to indicate buttons that need to be pressed?
      - can't tell the difference between an open door and a closed door
      - can hit issues going through the closed path of a door since it opens
        at a different tick on the next run through
        - ie: 1. go through open door
              2. door closes at step 1 and you go through the path it blocked when open
                 and then press the button to open the door
              3. door now closes at a later step than it did the first time so 2 becomes
                 impossible

- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -
  - disallow zooming in regular game
  - doors on the edge of the map opening/closing in fog is briefly visible
  - add modal for when you win the level
  - playtesting:
    - hard to tell when you're gonna run out of steps or hit a door
    - hard to tell when you're going to be in the line of sight of a previous self
    - may need to limit number of time reversals or else when you go through the
      last door you can just reverse time every two steps and never have to open that door
    - hard to tell where you should even go
      - implies mazes should be linear
      - OR that you should be able to see the map at the start
      - OR that levels are designed such that you can go the wrong way and have a chance
  - moving 2x per button press
    - skips 3rd history entry
    - renders entity moving the wrong way briefly at the start of the reverse time


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - need to make moves the same distance as player size
    - queue up 2 moves
      - display numActionIndex / 2 as number of steps
      - design all levels around having 2-wide moves
      - doors are now half as wide as character
    - OR shrink character
      - doors are now twice as long as character
    - should add little grid outlines to background for counting steps?

  - get level progression working on main play
    - add in more of the original levels
    - store level progress in local storage


- - - - - - FOLLOW UP - - - - - - - -
  - UI
    - add topBar
      - play/pause (probably don't need this at all?)
      - instructions
      - label for which direction time is moving
      - better styling for Steps Remaining label
    - bottom bar
      - button for going back in time
      - buttons for movements (mobile support)

  - animations:
    - show preview of going back in time if prev agent is about to do that
    - upon hitting a loss condition, need to animate before popping modal, etc
      - can make these actions with high effectIndex

  - deployment:
    - set up unique player tracking (and per level)

  - tutorials:


- - - - - - NICE-TO-HAVE - - - - - - - -
  - way to apply all entities w/ histories directly into game in order to repro bugs
  - allow time reversal to be queued on the controlled entity
    - add a flag to gameState for shouldReverseTime
    - when we would enqueue a new action to the controlledEntity but the flag is set,
      instead run the reverseTime helper
    - then continue as normal?
  - only 100 time travels is implicit, should be able to add more pheromones on the fly?


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - level editor playerID is 0 even though it says 1
  - doors opening/closing have a frame at final location before interpolating
  - moveTurn appears broken:
    - cancelling actions and replacing them is a problem
    - effect is that turn theta can end up undefined in reverseHistory
    - undefined turns get inserted when the entity fails to reverse correctly the first time
    - appears to be moveturn that is the problem


- - - - - - - REFACTORS - - - - - - -
  - tickReducer "systems" are checking waaay more often than they need to
  - instead of checking for existence of pheromoneWorker in insert/removeFromGrid
    entity functions, instead just rely on the noPheromone flag


- - - - - - - WON'T FIX - - - - - -
