- - - - - - TO THINK ABOUT - - - - - -
  - how to manage when doors close based on time travel
    - how to explain this in game?
  - grandfather? / what is the goal in the maze?


- - - - - - ISSUES - - - - - -
  - doors on the edge of the map opening/closing in fog is briefly visible
  - don't register arrow keys outside of editor (on game loss, modals that pause the game)


- - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
  - detect when you pass through an open door and flip a bit on the door
    - detect by doing a close rotation in place and checking for agents there
  - add grandfather entity
    - placeholder sprite

  - get level progression working on main play
    - add in more of the original levels
    - add in action to win the level
    - store level progress in local storage


- - - - - - FOLLOW UP - - - - - - - -
  - UI
    - add topBar
      - play/pause (probably don't need this at all?)
      - instructions
      - label for which direction time is moving
      - better styling for Steps Remaining label
    - bottom bar
      - button for going back in time
      - buttons for movements (mobile support)

  - animations:
    - show preview of going back in time if prev agent is about to do that
    - upon hitting a loss condition, need to animate before popping modal, etc

  - deployment:
    - set up unique player tracking (and per level)


- - - - - - NICE-TO-HAVE - - - - - - - -
  - way to apply all entities w/ histories directly into game in order to repro bugs
  - allow time reversal to be queued on the controlled entity
    - add a flag to gameState for shouldReverseTime
    - when we would enqueue a new action to the controlledEntity but the flag is set,
      instead run the reverseTime helper
    - then continue as normal?
  - only 100 time travels is implicit, should be able to add more pheromones on the fly?


- - - - - - - BUGS - - - - - - -
  - level editor playerID is 0 even though it says 1
  - doors opening/closing have a frame at final location before interpolating
  - moveTurn appears broken:
    - cancelling actions and replacing them is a problem
    - effect is that turn theta can end up undefined in reverseHistory
    - undefined turns get inserted when the entity fails to reverse correctly the first time
    - appears to be moveturn that is the problem

- - - - - - - WON'T FIX - - - - - -
